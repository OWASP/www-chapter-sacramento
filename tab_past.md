# Past Events

## November 2019
![Kick off Meetup](assets/images/kick-off-meetup.png)
Come join us for the inaugural event of the Sacramento OWASP Chapter. We have so
much AppSec, NetSec, and InfoSec talent in the Sacramento area that it’s time we
form a community for us to share our thoughts, experiences, and best practices.

The Sacramento OWASP chapter has been dormant for a while and it’s time to give
it a jump start. This will be our first official meeting. Come by, say hello,
put a face to a name, and maybe let us know what you’re interested in learning
or even contributing!

Please RSVP by October 15th so we can accommodate seating, snacks, and drinks.
